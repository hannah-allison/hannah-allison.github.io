All of the evening's events will take place in the outdoor courtyard of <a href="https://chabotspace.org/">Chabot Space and Science Center</a>, a science center and museum located in the Oakland hills. The ceremony will begin at 6:30 pm. Afterwards, please join us for a cocktail hour and reception. Cocktail attire is requested.
