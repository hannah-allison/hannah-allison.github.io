<h3>Getting to the Bay Area</h3>

There are three airports that serve the Bay Area: Oakland (OAK, 10 miles from downtown Oakland), San Francisco (SFO, 20 miles), and San Jose (SJC, 40 miles). OAK and SFO are likely the best options since they're closer and are connected to public transit. SFO is a United hub and is served by most airlines. OAK is almost entirely Southwest, and you have to go to their website to book, rather than Google Flights, Expedia, etc. If you're interested in flying into SJC, note that its largest airline is also Southwest.

<h3>Where to Stay</h3>

We don't have a hotel block. Most large brands have hotels in Emeryville and in downtown Oakland. There are also a number of Airbnb and VRBOs available in the area. If you're planning to rent a car, check parking fees, since they may be steep at some hotels.

<h3>Transportation</h3>

SFO and OAK both connect to <a href="https://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/sfo">BART</a>, the regional heavy rail system, which covers parts of Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. Chabot Space and Science Center is only accessible by car and has an ample parking garage. We recommend either renting a car, taking a taxi, or using a ride-sharing service like Lyft. We've found them to be pretty reliable, even in the evenings.
