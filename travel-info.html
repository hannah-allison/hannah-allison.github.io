<h3>Getting to the Bay Area</h3>

There are three airports that serve the Bay Area: Oakland (OAK, 10 miles from downtown Oakland), San Francisco (SFO, 20 miles), and San Jose (SJC, 40 miles). OAK and SFO are likely the best options since they're closer and are connected to public transit. SFO is a United hub and is served by most airlines. OAK is almost entirely Southwest, and you have to go to their website to book, rather than Google Flights, Expedia, etc. If you're interested in flying into SJC, note that its largest airline is also Southwest.

<h3>Where to Stay</h3>

Most large hotel brands have sites in Emeryville and in downtown Oakland, but we don't have a room block anywhere. There are also a number of Airbnb and VRBOs available in the area. If you're planning to rent a car, check parking fees, since they may be steep at some hotels.

<h3>Transportation</h3>

SFO and OAK both connect to <a href="https://www.bart.gov/guide/airport/sfo">BART</a>, the regional heavy rail system, which covers parts of Oakland, Berkeley, and San Francisco. Chabot Space and Science Center is only accessible by car and has an ample parking garage. We recommend either renting a car (either from the airport or a place in town), taking a taxi, or using a ride-sharing service like Lyft. We've found them to be pretty reliable, even in the evenings.

<h3>Things to Do</h3>

There's a lot to do in <a href="visitoakland.com">Oakland</a>, <a href="visitberkeley.com">Berkeley</a>, and <a href="sftravel.com">San Francisco</a>. Some particular favorites of ours:
<ul>
<li> Regional Parks: There are some parks with great hiking and views in Berkeley and Oakland. The venue is nestled between several (Joaquin Miller, Reinhardt Redwood, and Roberts). Tilden in Berkeley is another favorite of ours.
<li> Farmers Markets: There's a market at the Ferry Building in San Francisco on Saturday mornings, and one in the Temescal neighborhood in Oakland on Sundays. The stone fruit and berries are fantastic this time of year, and many stands pass out samples.
