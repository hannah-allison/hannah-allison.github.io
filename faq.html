<h4>Will it be cold/rainy/cloudy?</h4>

Usually, there is very little precipitation in Oakland in late June and early July. This year has been unusually wet, but that seems to be tapering off (as of April). On the off chance that we have rain or other inclement weather, we will move the event inside. Chabot is at 1,500 feet above sea level, so its weather tends to be cooler and foggier than the flat portions of the city. We recommend bringing an extra layer, since the temperature is likely to cool off once the sun sets at 8:30. Chabot has its own <a href="https://chabotspace.org/weather-station/observatory-weather-details/">weather station</a>, which may be more reliable than data taken at the airport.
